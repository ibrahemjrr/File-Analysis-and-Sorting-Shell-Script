In this Project the goal was to  make a script that can accepts a directory path as an argument and searche for all files with a specific extension (e.g., .txt) in the given directory and its subdirectories then generate a comprehensive report in a text file that includes:
- File details such as size, owner, permissions and last modified timestamp.
- Groups and sort the files by the total size occupied by each owner.
- Saves the report in a file named "file_analysis.txt".
The Script also supports :
- Support for multiple file extensions, allowing users to search for files with various extensions simultaneously.
- It includes an option to filter files based on size, permissions, or last modified 4mestamp, allowing users to customize their search criteria.
- Generating a summary report that displays total file count, total size, and other relevant statistics.
